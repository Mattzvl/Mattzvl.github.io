## My first web page using Papet kit 2 as template. 
<h5> With some changes made by my self to customize </h5>

My intention with this page is to show a little about myself, my background and interests.<br>
Also, it includes an invitation to visualize some projects that I have done and uploaded to other platforms besides Git, such as Tableau Public, or PowerBI.<br>
This page is in constant development, where I will continuously share in one way or another projects that will surely be of interest to the community.<br>
